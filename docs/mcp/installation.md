# 📥 Playwright — MCP Installation

> **Source:** [playwright.dev/mcp/installation](https://playwright.dev/mcp/installation)

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20 or newer**
- An **MCP client**: VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Claude Desktop, or similar

## Installation

Add the Playwright MCP server to your client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

> See **Client Setup** for client-specific instructions.

The browser downloads automatically on first use.

## First Interaction

Ask your AI assistant:

> Navigate to https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc and add a few todo items.

The assistant calls MCP tools to open the browser, navigate, and interact — returning accessibility snapshots at each step:

```
→ browser_navigate
  { url: "https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc" }

→ browser_snapshot
  - heading "todos" [level=1]
  - textbox "What needs to be done?" [ref=e5]

→ browser_type
  { ref: "e5", text: "Buy groceries", submit: true }

→ browser_snapshot
  - heading "todos" [level=1]
  - textbox "What needs to be done?" [ref=e5]
  - listitem:
      - checkbox "Toggle Todo" [ref=e10]
      - text: "Buy groceries"
  - contentinfo:
      - text: "1 item left"
```

## The Workflow

Every MCP interaction follows this cycle:

1. **Navigate** — `browser_navigate` opens a URL
2. **Snapshot** — tools return the accessibility tree with element refs
3. **Interact** — the LLM uses refs to click, type, or fill
4. **Re-snapshot** — each action returns updated state

The browser opens in **headed mode** by default so you can watch. Pass `--headless` to run without a visible window.

## Example Prompts

- Go to https://example.com and take a screenshot.
- Open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc, add three todos, check off the first one, and take a screenshot.
- Navigate to https://news.ycombinator.com and list the top 5 stories.
- Save the current browser state to auth.json so we can skip login next time.

## Next Steps

- **Snapshots** — how element refs work
- **Capabilities** — enable network mocking, storage, testing, and more
- **Configuration** — headless mode, browser selection, profiles
