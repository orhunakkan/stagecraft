## Introduction

For every attachment downloaded by the page, `page.on('download')` event is emitted. All these attachments are downloaded into a temporary folder. You can obtain the download url, file name and payload stream using the `Download` object from the event. You can specify where to persist downloaded files using the `downloadsPath` option in `browserType.launch()`.

> **Note:** Downloaded files are deleted when the browser context that produced them is closed.

Here is the simplest way to handle the file download:

```ts
// Start waiting for download before clicking. Note no await.
const downloadPromise = page.waitForEvent('download');
await page.getByText('Download file').click();
const download = await downloadPromise;
// Wait for the download process to complete and save the downloaded file somewhere.
await download.saveAs('/path/to/save/at/' + download.suggestedFilename());
```

## Variations

If you have no idea what initiates the download, you can still handle the event:

```ts
page.on('download', (download) => download.path().then(console.log));
```

Note that handling the event forks the control flow and makes the script harder to follow. Your scenario might end while you are downloading a file since your main control flow is not awaiting for this operation to resolve.

> **Note:** For uploading files, see the uploading files section.
