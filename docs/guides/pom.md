## Introduction

Large test suites can be structured to optimize ease of authoring and maintenance. Page object models are one such approach to structure your test suite. A page object represents a part of your web application. An e-commerce web application might have a home page, a listings page and a checkout page. Each of them can be represented by page object models.

Page objects simplify authoring by creating a higher-level API which suits your application and simplify maintenance by capturing element selectors in one place and create reusable code to avoid repetition.

## Implementation

We will create a `PlaywrightDevPage` helper class to encapsulate common operations on the playwright.dev page. Internally, it will use the page object.

```ts
// playwright-dev-page.ts
import { expect, type Locator, type Page } from '@playwright/test';

export class PlaywrightDevPage {
  readonly page: Page;
  readonly getStartedLink: Locator;
  readonly gettingStartedHeader: Locator;
  readonly pomLink: Locator;
  readonly tocList: Locator;

  constructor(page: Page) {
    this.page = page;
    this.getStartedLink = page.locator('a', { hasText: 'Get started' });
    this.gettingStartedHeader = page.locator('h1', { hasText: 'Installation' });
    this.pomLink = page
      .locator('li', {
        hasText: 'Guides',
      })
      .locator('a', {
        hasText: 'Page Object Model',
      });
    this.tocList = page.locator('article div.markdown ul > li > a');
  }

  async goto() {
    await this.page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
  }

  async getStarted() {
    await this.getStartedLink.first().click();
    await expect(this.gettingStartedHeader).toBeVisible();
  }

  async pageObjectModel() {
    await this.getStarted();
    await this.pomLink.click();
  }
}
```

Now we can use the `PlaywrightDevPage` class in our tests.

```ts
// example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { PlaywrightDevPage } from './playwright-dev-page';

test('getting started should contain table of contents', async ({ page }) => {
  const playwrightDev = new PlaywrightDevPage(page);
  await playwrightDev.goto();
  await playwrightDev.getStarted();
  await expect(playwrightDev.tocList).toHaveText([
    `How to install Playwright`,
    `What's installed`,
    `How to run the example test`,
    `How to open the HTML test report`,
    `Write tests using web-first assertions, fixtures and locators`,
    `Run single or multiple tests; headed mode`,
    `Generate tests with Codegen`,
    `View a trace of your tests`,
  ]);
});

test('should show Page Object Model article', async ({ page }) => {
  const playwrightDev = new PlaywrightDevPage(page);
  await playwrightDev.goto();
  await playwrightDev.pageObjectModel();
  await expect(page.locator('article')).toContainText('Page Object Model is a common pattern');
});
```
