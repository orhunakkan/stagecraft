# ⚡ Playwright — Auto-waiting

## Introduction

Playwright performs a range of actionability checks on the elements before making actions to ensure these actions behave as expected. It auto-waits for all the relevant checks to pass and only then performs the requested action. If the required checks do not pass within the given timeout, action fails with the `TimeoutError`.

For example, for `locator.click()`, Playwright will ensure that:

- locator resolves to exactly one element
- element is **Visible**
- element is **Stable**, as in not animating or completed animation
- element **Receives Events**, as in not obscured by other elements
- element is **Enabled**

Here is the complete list of actionability checks performed for each action:

| Action                             | Visible | Stable | Receives Events | Enabled | Editable |
| ---------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | --------------- | ------- | -------- |

## Forcing actions

Some actions like `locator.click()` support `force` option that disables non-essential actionability checks, for example passing truthy `force` to `locator.click()` method will not check that the target element actually receives click events.

## Assertions

Playwright includes auto-retrying assertions that remove flakiness by waiting until the condition is met, similarly to auto-waiting before actions.

| Assertion                            | Description                       |

## Visible

Element is considered visible when it has non-empty bounding box and does not have `visibility:hidden` computed style.

Note that according to this definition:

- Elements of zero size are **not considered visible**.
- Elements with `display:none` are **not considered visible**.
- Elements with `opacity:0` **are considered visible**.

## Stable

Element is considered stable when it has maintained the same bounding box for at least two consecutive animation frames.

## Enabled

Element is considered enabled when it is not disabled. Element is disabled when:

- it is a `<button>`, `<select>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<option>` or `<optgroup>` with a `[disabled]` attribute;
- it is a `<button>`, `<select>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<option>` or `<optgroup>` that is a part of a `<fieldset>` with a `[disabled]` attribute;
- it is a descendant of an element with `[aria-disabled=true]` attribute.

## Editable

Element is considered editable when it is enabled and is not readonly. Element is readonly when:

- it is a `<select>`, `<input>` or `<textarea>` with a `[readonly]` attribute;
- it has an `[aria-readonly=true]` attribute and an aria role that supports it.

## Receives Events

Element is considered receiving pointer events when it is the hit target of the pointer event at the action point. For example, when clicking at the point `(10;10)`, Playwright checks whether some other element (usually an overlay) will instead capture the click at `(10;10)`.

For example, consider a scenario where Playwright will click **Sign Up** button regardless of when the `locator.click()` call was made:

- page is checking that user name is unique and **Sign Up** button is disabled;
- after checking with the server, the disabled **Sign Up** button is replaced with another one that is now enabled.
