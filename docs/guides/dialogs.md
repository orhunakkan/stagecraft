# 💬 Playwright — Dialogs

## Introduction

Playwright can interact with the web page dialogs such as alert, confirm, prompt as well as beforeunload confirmation.

For print dialogs, see the [Print dialogs](#print-dialogs) section below.

## alert(), confirm(), prompt() dialogs

By default, dialogs are auto-dismissed by Playwright, so you don't have to handle them. However, you can register a dialog handler before the action that triggers the dialog to either `dialog.accept()` or `dialog.dismiss()` it.

```ts
page.on('dialog', (dialog) => dialog.accept());
await page.getByRole('button').click();
```

> **Note:** The `page.on('dialog')` listener must handle the dialog. Otherwise your action will stall, be it `locator.click()` or something else. That's because dialogs in Web are modals and therefore block further page execution until they are handled.

As a result, the following snippet will never resolve:

> **Warning:** WRONG!

```ts
page.on('dialog', (dialog) => console.log(dialog.message()));
await page.getByRole('button').click(); // Will hang here
```

> **Note:** If there is no listener for `page.on('dialog')`, all dialogs are automatically dismissed.

## beforeunload dialog

When `page.close()` is invoked with the truthy `runBeforeUnload` value, the page runs its unload handlers. This is the only case when `page.close()` does not wait for the page to actually close, because it might be that the page stays open in the end of the operation. You can register a dialog handler to handle the `beforeunload` dialog yourself:

```ts
page.on('dialog', async (dialog) => {
  assert(dialog.type() === 'beforeunload');
  await dialog.dismiss();
});
await page.close({ runBeforeUnload: true });
```

## Print dialogs

In order to assert that a print dialog via `window.print` was triggered, you can use the following snippet:

```ts
await page.goto('<url>');
await page.evaluate('(() => {window.waitForPrintDialog = new Promise(f => window.print = f);})()');
await page.getByText('Print it!').click();
await page.waitForFunction('window.waitForPrintDialog');
```

This will wait for the print dialog to be opened after the button is clicked. Make sure to evaluate the script before clicking the button / after the page is loaded.
