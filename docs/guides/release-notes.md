## Version 1.59

### Screencast

New `page.screencast` API provides a unified interface for capturing page content with:

- Screencast recordings
- Action annotations
- Visual overlays
- Real-time frame capture
- Agentic video receipts

**Screencast recording** — record video with precise start/stop control, as an alternative to the `recordVideo` option:

```ts
await page.screencast.start({ path: 'video.webm' });
// ... perform actions ...
await page.screencast.stop();
```

**Action annotations** — enable built-in visual annotations that highlight interacted elements and display action titles during recording:

```ts
await page.screencast.showActions({ position: 'top-right' });
```

`screencast.showActions()` accepts `position` (`'top-left'`, `'top'`, `'top-right'`, `'bottom-left'`, `'bottom'`, `'bottom-right'`), `duration` (ms per annotation), and `fontSize` (px). Returns a disposable to stop showing actions.

Action annotations can also be enabled in test fixtures via the `video` option:

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    video: {
      mode: 'on',
      show: {
        actions: { position: 'top-left' },
        test: { position: 'top-right' },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

**Visual overlays** — add chapter titles and custom HTML overlays on top of the page for richer narration:

```ts
await page.screencast.showChapter('Adding TODOs', {
  description: 'Type and press enter for each TODO',
  duration: 1000,
});
await page.screencast.showOverlay('<div style="color: red">Recording</div>');
```

**Real-time frame capture** — stream JPEG-encoded frames for custom processing like thumbnails, live previews, AI vision, and more:

```ts
await page.screencast.start({
  onFrame: ({ data }) => sendToVisionModel(data),
  size: { width: 800, height: 600 },
});
```

**Agentic video receipts** — coding agents can produce video evidence of their work:

```ts
await page.screencast.start({ path: 'receipt.webm' });
await page.screencast.showActions({ position: 'top-right' });
await page.screencast.showChapter('Verifying checkout flow', {
  description: 'Added coupon code support per ticket #1234',
});
// Agent performs the verification steps...
await page.locator('#coupon').fill('SAVE20');
await page.locator('#apply-coupon').click();
await expect(page.locator('.discount')).toContainText('20%');
await page.screencast.showChapter('Done', {
  description: 'Coupon applied, discount reflected in total',
});
await page.screencast.stop();
```

### Interoperability

New `browser.bind()` API makes a launched browser available for `playwright-cli`, `@playwright/mcp`, and other clients to connect to.

**Bind a browser** — start a browser and bind it so others can connect:

```ts
const { endpoint } = await browser.bind('my-session', {
  workspaceDir: '/my/project',
});
```

**Connect from playwright-cli** — connect to the running browser from your favorite coding agent:

```bash
playwright-cli attach my-session
playwright-cli -s my-session snapshot
```

**Connect from @playwright/mcp** — or point your MCP server to the running browser:

```bash
@playwright/mcp --endpoint=my-session
```

**Connect from a Playwright client** — use API to connect to the browser. Multiple clients at a time are supported:

```ts
const browser = await chromium.connect(endpoint);
```

Pass `host` and `port` options to bind over WebSocket instead of a named pipe:

```ts
const { endpoint } = await browser.bind('my-session', {
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 0,
});
// endpoint is a ws:// URL
```

Call `browser.unbind()` to stop accepting new connections.

### Observability

Run `playwright-cli show` to open the Dashboard that lists all the bound browsers, their statuses, and allows interacting with them:

- See what your agent is doing on the background browsers
- Click into the sessions for manual interventions
- Open DevTools to inspect pages from the background browsers

`playwright-cli` binds all of its browsers automatically, so you can see what your agents are doing. Pass `PLAYWRIGHT_DASHBOARD=1` env variable to see all `@playwright/test` browsers in the dashboard.

### CLI debugger for agents

Coding agents can now run `npx playwright test --debug=cli` to attach and debug tests over `playwright-cli` — perfect for automatically fixing tests in agentic workflows:

```bash
$ npx playwright test --debug=cli
### Debugging Instructions
- Run "playwright-cli attach tw-87b59e" to attach to this test
$ playwright-cli attach tw-87b59e
### Session `tw-87b59e` created, attached to `tw-87b59e`.
Run commands with: playwright-cli --session=tw-87b59e <command>
### Paused
- Navigate to "/" at output/tests/example.spec.ts:4
$ playwright-cli --session tw-87b59e step-over
### Page
- Page URL: https://playwright.dev/
- Page Title: Fast and reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps | Playwright
### Paused
- Expect "toHaveTitle" at output/tests/example.spec.ts:7
```

### CLI trace analysis for agents

Coding agents can run `npx playwright trace` to explore Playwright Trace and understand failing or flaky tests from the command line:

```bash
$ npx playwright trace open test-results/example-has-title-chromium/trace.zip
Title: example.spec.ts:3 › has title
$ npx playwright trace actions --grep="expect"
 # Time   Action                                                         Duration
──── ─────────── ───────────────────────────────────────────────────── ────────
 9.  0:00.859   Expect "toHaveTitle"                                       5.1s ✗
$ npx playwright trace action 9
Expect "toHaveTitle"
Error: expect(page).toHaveTitle(expected) failed
Expected pattern: /Wrong Title/
Received string:  "Fast and reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps | Playwright"
Timeout: 5000ms
Snapshots available: before, after
usage: npx playwright trace snapshot 9 --name <before|after>
$ npx playwright trace snapshot 9 --name after
### Page
- Page Title: Fast and reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps | Playwright
$ npx playwright trace close
```

### `await using`

Many APIs now return async disposables, enabling the `await using` syntax for automatic cleanup:

```ts
await using page = await context.newPage();
{
  await using route = await page.route('**/*', (route) => route.continue());
  await using script = await page.addInitScript('console.log("init script here")');
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
  // do something
}
// route and init script have been removed at this point
```

### Snapshots and Locators

- Method `page.ariaSnapshot()` to capture the aria snapshot of the page — equivalent to `page.locator('body').ariaSnapshot()`.
- Options `depth` and `mode` in `locator.ariaSnapshot()`.
- Method `locator.normalize()` converts a locator to follow best practices like test ids and aria roles.
- Method `page.pickLocator()` enters an interactive mode where hovering over elements highlights them and shows the corresponding locator. Click an element to get its Locator back. Use `page.cancelPickLocator()` to cancel.

### New APIs

**Screencast**

- `page.screencast` provides video recording, real-time frame streaming, and overlay management.
- Methods `screencast.start()` and `screencast.stop()` for recording and frame capture.
- Methods `screencast.showActions()` and `screencast.hideActions()` for action annotations.
- Methods `screencast.showChapter()` and `screencast.showOverlay()` for visual overlays.
- Methods `screencast.showOverlays()` and `screencast.hideOverlays()` for overlay visibility control.

**Storage, Console and Errors**

- Method `browserContext.setStorageState()` clears existing cookies, local storage, and IndexedDB for all origins and sets a new storage state — no need to create a new context.
- Methods `page.clearConsoleMessages()` and `page.clearPageErrors()` to clear stored messages and errors.
- Option `filter` in `page.consoleMessages()` and `page.pageErrors()` controls which messages are returned.
- Method `consoleMessage.timestamp()`.

**Miscellaneous**

- `browserContext.debugger` provides programmatic control over the Playwright debugger.
- Method `browserContext.isClosed()`.
- Method `request.existingResponse()` returns the response without waiting.
- Method `response.httpVersion()` returns the HTTP version used by the response.
- Events `cdpSession.on('event')` and `cdpSession.on('close')` for CDP sessions.
- Option `live` in `tracing.start()` for real-time trace updates.
- Option `artifactsDir` in `browserType.launch()` to configure the artifacts directory.

### Other improvements

- UI Mode has an option to only show tests affected by source changes.
- UI Mode and Trace Viewer have improved action filtering.
- HTML Reporter shows the list of runs from the same worker.
- HTML Reporter allows filtering test steps for quick search.
- New trace mode `'retain-on-failure-and-retries'` records a trace for each test run and retains all traces when an attempt fails.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed macOS 14 support for WebKit. We recommend upgrading your macOS version, or keeping an older Playwright version.
- Removed `@playwright/experimental-ct-svelte` package.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 147.0.7727.15
- Mozilla Firefox 148.0.2
- WebKit 26.4

This version was also tested against the following stable channels: Google Chrome 146, Microsoft Edge 146.

## Version 1.58

### Timeline

If you're using merged reports, the HTML report Speedboard tab now shows the Timeline.

### UI Mode and Trace Viewer Improvements

- New `'system'` theme option follows your OS dark/light mode preference.
- Search functionality (Cmd/Ctrl+F) is now available in code editors.
- Network details panel has been reorganized for better usability.
- JSON responses are now automatically formatted for readability.

### Miscellaneous

- `browserType.connectOverCDP()` now accepts an `isLocal` option. When set to `true`, it tells Playwright that it runs on the same host as the CDP server, enabling file system optimizations.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `_react` and `_vue` selectors. See locators guide for alternatives.
- Removed `:light` selector engine suffix. Use standard CSS selectors instead.
- Option `devtools` from `browserType.launch()` has been removed. Use `args: ['--auto-open-devtools-for-tabs']` instead.
- Removed macOS 13 support for WebKit. We recommend to upgrade your macOS version, or keep using an older Playwright version.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 145.0.7632.6
- Mozilla Firefox 146.0.1
- WebKit 26.0

This version was also tested against the following stable channels: Google Chrome 144, Microsoft Edge 144.

## Version 1.57

### Speedboard

In HTML reporter, there's a new tab called "Speedboard". It shows you all your executed tests sorted by slowness, and can help you understand where your test suite is taking longer than expected.

### Chrome for Testing

Playwright now runs on Chrome for Testing builds rather than Chromium. Headed mode uses `chrome`; headless mode uses `chrome-headless-shell`. Existing tests should continue to pass after upgrading to v1.57.

On Arm64 Linux, Playwright continues to use Chromium.

### Waiting for webserver output

`testConfig.webServer` added a `wait` field. Pass a regular expression, and Playwright will wait until the webserver logs match it.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start',
    wait: { stdout: /Listening on port (?<my_server_port>\d+)/ },
  },
});
```

If you include a named capture group into the expression, then Playwright will provide the capture group contents via environment variables:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
test.use({ baseURL: `http://localhost:${process.env.MY_SERVER_PORT ?? 3000}` });
test('homepage', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
});
```

### Breaking Change

After 3 years of being deprecated, `page.accessibility` was removed from the API. Please use other libraries such as Axe if you need to test page accessibility.

### New APIs

- New property `testConfig.tag` adds a tag to all tests in this run. This is useful when using `merge-reports`.
- `worker.on('console')` event is emitted when JavaScript within the worker calls one of console API methods.
- `locator.description()` returns locator description previously set with `locator.describe()`, and `locator.toString()` now uses the description when available.
- New option `steps` in `locator.click()` and `locator.dragTo()` that configures the number of `mousemove` events emitted while moving the mouse pointer to the target element.
- Network requests issued by Service Workers are now reported and can be routed through the `BrowserContext`, only in Chromium.

### Browser Versions

- Chromium 143.0.7499.4
- Mozilla Firefox 144.0.2
- WebKit 26.0

## Version 1.56

### Playwright Test Agents

Introducing Playwright Test Agents, three custom agent definitions designed to guide LLMs through the core process of building a Playwright test:

- planner explores the app and produces a Markdown test plan
- generator transforms the Markdown plan into the Playwright Test files
- healer executes the test suite and automatically repairs failing tests

Run `npx playwright init-agents` with your client of choice to generate the latest agent definitions:

```bash
# Visual Studio Code
npx playwright init-agents --loop=vscode

# Claude Code
npx playwright init-agents --loop=claude

# opencode
npx playwright init-agents --loop=opencode
```

### New APIs

- New methods `page.consoleMessages()` and `page.pageErrors()` for retrieving the most recent console messages from the page.
- New method `page.requests()` for retrieving the most recent network requests from the page.
- Added `--test-list` and `--test-list-invert` to allow manual specification of specific tests from a file.

### Breaking Changes

- Event `browserContext.on('backgroundpage')` has been deprecated and will not be emitted.
- Method `browserContext.backgroundPages()` will return an empty list.

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [['html', { noSnippets: true }]],
});
```

- New property `location` in test annotations. It shows where the annotation like `test.skip` or `test.fixme` was added.

### Command Line

- New option `--user-data-dir` in multiple commands:

```bash
npx playwright codegen --user-data-dir=./user-data
```

- Option `-gv` has been removed from the `npx playwright test` command. Use `--grep-invert` instead.

```

Aria Snapshots got two new properties: `/children` for strict matching and `/url` for links:

```ts
await expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
  - list
  - /children: equal
  - listitem: Feature A
  - listitem:
    - link "Feature B":
      - /url: "https://playwright.dev"`);
```

```ts
// tests/auth.setup.ts
import { test as setup, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import path from 'path';
const authFile = path.join(__dirname, '../playwright/.auth/user.json');

setup('authenticate', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  // ... perform authentication steps ...
  // make sure to save indexedDB
  await page.context().storageState({ path: authFile, indexedDB: true });
});
```

### Copy as prompt

New "Copy prompt" button on errors in the HTML report, trace viewer and UI mode. Click to copy a pre-filled LLM prompt that contains the error message and useful context for fixing the error.

### Filter visible elements

New option `visible` for `locator.filter()` allows matching only visible elements:

```ts
test('some test', async ({ page }) => {
  // Ignore invisible todo items.
  const todoItems = page.getByTestId('todo-item').filter({ visible: true });
  // Check there are exactly 3 visible ones.
  await expect(todoItems).toHaveCount(3);
});
```

### Git information in HTML report

Set option `testConfig.captureGitInfo` to capture git information into `testConfig.metadata`:

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  captureGitInfo: { commit: true, diff: true },
});
```

### Test Step improvements

A new `TestStepInfo` object is now available in test steps:

```ts
test('some test', async ({ page, isMobile }) => {
  // Note the new "step" argument:
  await test.step('here is my step', async (step) => {
    step.skip(isMobile, 'not relevant on mobile layouts');
    // ...
    await step.attach('my attachment', { body: 'some text' });

## Version 1.50

### Test runner

New option `timeout` allows specifying a maximum run time for an individual test step:

```ts
test('some test', async ({ page }) => {
  await test.step(
    'a step',
    async () => {
      // This step can time out separately from the test
    },
    { timeout: 1000 }
  );
});
```

New method `test.step.skip()` to disable execution of a test step:

```ts
test('some test', async ({ page }) => {
  await test.step('before running step', async () => {
    // Normal step
  });
  await test.step.skip('not yet ready', async () => {
    // This step is skipped
  });
  await test.step('after running step', async () => {
    // This step still runs even though the previous one was skipped
  });
});
```

Expanded `expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot()` to allow storing of aria snapshots in separate YAML files.

Added method `expect(locator).toHaveAccessibleErrorMessage()` to assert the Locator points to an element with a given aria `errormessage`.

### Browser Versions

- Mozilla Firefox 134.0
- WebKit 18.2

## Version 1.49

### Aria snapshots

New assertion `expect(locator).toMatchAriaSnapshot()` verifies page structure by comparing to an expected accessibility tree, represented as YAML:

```ts
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev');
await expect(page.locator('body')).toMatchAriaSnapshot(`
  - banner:
    - heading /Playwright enables reliable/ [level=1]
    - link "Get started"
    - link "Star microsoft/playwright on GitHub"
  - main:
    - img "Browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)"
    - heading "Any browser • Any platform • One API"`);
```

### Test runner

    clientCertificates: [
      {
        origin: 'https://example.com',
        certPath: './cert.pem',
        keyPath: './key.pem',
        passphrase: 'mysecretpassword',
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

### `--only-changed` CLI option

```bash
# Only run test files with uncommitted changes
npx playwright test --only-changed

# Only run test files changed relative to the "main" branch
npx playwright test --only-changed=main
```

### Component Testing: New `router` fixture

```ts
import { handlers } from '@src/mocks/handlers';

test.beforeEach(async ({ router }) => {
  // install common handlers before each test
  await router.use(...handlers);
});

test('example test', async ({ mount }) => {
  // test as usual, your handlers are active
  // ...
});
```

### Browser Versions

### Clock

Utilizing the new Clock API allows to manipulate and control time within tests:

```ts
// Initialize clock and let the page load naturally.
await page.clock.install({ time: new Date('2024-02-02T08:00:00') });
await page.goto('http://localhost:3333');
// Pretend that the user closed the laptop lid and opened it again at 10am,
// Pause the time once reached that point.
await page.clock.pauseAt(new Date('2024-02-02T10:00:00'));
// Assert the page state.
await expect(page.getByTestId('current-time')).toHaveText('2/2/2024, 10:00:00 AM');
// Close the laptop lid again and open it at 10:30am.
await page.clock.fastForward('30:00');
await expect(page.getByTestId('current-time')).toHaveText('2/2/2024, 10:30:00 AM');
```

### Test runner

- New CLI option `--fail-on-flaky-tests` that sets exit code to 1 upon any flaky tests.
- New environment variable `PLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY` controls whether built-in reporters assume a live terminal.

```bash
# Avoid TTY features that output ANSI control sequences
PLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY=0 npx playwright test
# Enable TTY features, assuming a terminal width 80
PLAYWRIGHT_FORCE_TTY=80 npx playwright test
```

  use: { trace: 'retain-on-first-failure' },
});
```

New method `locator.contentFrame()` converts a Locator object to a FrameLocator:

const locator = page.locator('iframe[name="embedded"]');
// ...
const frameLocator = locator.contentFrame();
await frameLocator.getByRole('button').click();
```

New method `frameLocator.owner()` converts a FrameLocator object to a Locator:

## Version 1.39

### Add custom matchers to your `expect`

```ts
// test.spec.ts
import { expect as baseExpect } from '@playwright/test';

export const expect = baseExpect.extend({
  async toHaveAmount(locator: Locator, expected: number, options?: { timeout?: number }) {
    // ... see documentation for how to write matchers.

```ts
const button = page.getByRole('button');
// Make sure at least some part of element intersects viewport.
await expect(button).toBeInViewport();

await button.click('button >> visible=true');
```

### Web-First Assertions

```ts
await expect(page.locator('.status')).toHaveText('Submitted');
```

### Serial mode with `describe.serial`

```ts
test.describe.serial('group', () => {
  test('runs first', async ({ page }) => {
    /* ... */
  });
  test('runs second', async ({ page }) => {
    /* ... */
  });
});
```

### Steps API with `test.step`

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('test', async ({ page }) => {
  await test.step('Log in', async () => {
    // ...
  });
  await test.step('news feed', async () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

### Launch web server before running tests

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run start', // command to launch
    url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000', // url to await for
    timeout: 120 * 1000,
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```
