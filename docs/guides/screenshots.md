## Introduction

Here is a quick way to capture a screenshot and save it into a file:

```ts
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });
```

Screenshots API accepts many parameters for image format, clip area, quality, etc. Make sure to check them out.

## Full page screenshots

Full page screenshot is a screenshot of a full scrollable page, as if you had a very tall screen and the page could fit it entirely.

```ts
await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png', fullPage: true });
```

## Capture into buffer

Rather than writing into a file, you can get a buffer with the image and post-process it or pass it to a third party pixel diff facility.

```ts
const buffer = await page.screenshot();
console.log(buffer.toString('base64'));
```

## Element screenshot

Sometimes it is useful to take a screenshot of a single element.

```ts
await page.locator('.header').screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });
```
